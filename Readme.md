## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi, my name is Gopikrishnan N M. I have 3 years of experience in Quality Assurance, with a strong background in both manual and automation testing. I have hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver for UI automation, API testing using Postman, and writing SQL queries for backend validation. 

I also have a basic understanding of web technologies including Spring Boot and JavaScript, which helps me better understand the application flow and improve test coverage.
